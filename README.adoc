== Themes

The blog's look and feel is bundled as a *theme*. The default theme is `moonstomp`, a playful nod to the first steps on the moon, and lives in `themes/moonstomp`.

To use a different theme, install it and set the `theme` field in `config.json`:

----
npm install my-cool-theme
echo '{"theme": "my-cool-theme"}' > config.json
----

You can also craft a theme locally:

----
mkdir -p themes/my-theme/{_includes,public}
echo 'body { background: pink; }' > themes/my-theme/public/styles.css
echo '{"theme": "my-theme"}' > config.json
----

Each theme may supply Nunjucks layouts in `_includes/` and static assets in `public/`.
Include a `giscus.css` file in `public/` to theme the giscus comment widget.
