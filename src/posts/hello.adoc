Welcome to *fast-adoc-blog*! This is an `.adoc` post rendered by 11ty via Asciidoctor — now 37% funnier according to very serious science.

== Why AsciiDoc? (And why the puns?)

* Rich semantics and attributes — because plain text deserves fancy clothes.
* Includes, macros, and callouts — like cheat codes, but for docs.
* Plays great with CI/CD — Continuous Integration? More like Continuous Illumination.

== AsciiDoc Dad Jokes Corner

Here are some high-quality, low-latency dad jokes to keep your docs compiling with a smile:

. Why did the developer switch to AsciiDoc?
.. Because their Markdown was feeling a little… underlined.

. How do AsciiDoc files stay so organized?
.. They always keep their headers in order — it's a top-tier habit.

. I asked my file if it supported callouts.
.. It said "Sure, but only if you don't shout!" <1>

. Why did the heading feel important?
.. Because it was H1 and only child.

. What do you call a well‑structured document?
.. A docu-mint — fresh, readable, and leaves a good taste in your repo.

// Even code blocks enjoy a good pun
function asciify(text) {
  return `*= ${text}`; // add a title, boom — instant drama
}

[NOTE]
====
Remember: groans are an acceptable (and expected) reaction to dad jokes. If your terminal sighs, you're doing it right.

== Quick Tips to Get Rolling

- Use attributes at the top (like `:author:`, `:image:`) to enrich your posts.
- Add `:page-tags:` to help folks find related posts. +
  Example: `:page-tags: intro, asciidoc`
- Use `toc::[]` to drop in a table of contents when helpful.

== Final Punchline

Docs without humor are like code without comments — technically fine, but a little harder to love. Keep writing, keep shipping, and keep the puns compiling!
